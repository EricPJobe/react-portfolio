                <p className={"text"}>While taking Spanish in high school, I happened upon a Greek New Testament at a local
                bookstore. Reading the Bible in its original languages suddenly apprehended me with unrelenting fascination.
                I soon found introductions to Biblical Greek and Hebrew and began to teach myself at home and during lunch at school.
                At this time, I became fascinated with languages in general, and my course in life was set toward this aim.</p>

                <p className={"text"}>During my undergraduate career, along with German, I studied Biblical Greek and Hebrew formally and began
                teaching myself Biblical Aramaic and Akkadian. By the time I graduated, I could read Biblical Aramaic fluently.
                During graduate school, the North-West Semitic languages became my focus with Hebrew being my most specialized covering
                historical grammar, inscriptions, standard biblical, Qumran, rabbinic, and medieval stages and dialects. In the
                Aramaic group, I covered Old, Imperial, Nabataean, Palestinian Jewish, standard literary Jewish, and Christian Palestinian Aramaic
                along with extensive study of Syriac including editing manuscripts. Additionally, I gained some facility with Ugaritic, Classical Arabic,
                and Ethiopic Ge'ez.</p>
